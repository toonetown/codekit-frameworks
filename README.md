#CodeKit Frameworks

These are a collection of repackaged web libraries for use within [CodeKit](http://www.incident57.com/codekit) as 
frameworks.  These only contain the LESS, JavaScript or other static files.  Since CodeKit doesn't allow the same
file name to be used multiple times, then some of the files (specifically the LESS files - which very often have
a `variables.less` file) have been prefixed to be unique.  The "main" file (i.e. `bootstrap.less`) have not been
renamed.

To use these frameworks, just point CodeKit to each subdirectory (or even to this directory if you just want to 
import all of them into a single framework).

There have been *no* modifications to any of these packages - aside from the renaming of files.
